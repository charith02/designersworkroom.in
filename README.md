A web solution for an interior design firm in Delhi using the MERN stack. I crafted a visually engaging frontend with React and CSS to highlight the firmâ€™s services, while implementing secure, efficient backend APIs with Node.js and Express.js. The project was deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).
